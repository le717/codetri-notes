        <h2>#vss365today - Site Paused</h2>
        <h6>Published <code>2023-02-08T00:00:00-05:00</code></h6>
        <p>
  Due to the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api">Twitter API</a> becoming a paid access API some time <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621026986784337922">tomorrow</a>,
  with pricing still to be announced, <a href="https://vss365today.com">#vss365 today</a> has been forced to stop auto-updating itself
  with the latest #vss365 Prompt. Effective immediately, no new Prompts, notification emails, or spreadsheet archives will be generated or made available. Additionally, new notification email registrations has been disabled.
</p>

<p>
  All existing Prompts, as well as the newest available spreadsheet archive, will remain online and unchanged.
  All other site aspects will also remain available.
</p>

<p>
  This pause will remain in effect until Twitter API access pricing has been announced
  and a suitable plan going forward is developed. Should the pause be removed, all missing Prompts will be loaded
  into the site to ensure a complete archive is available.
</p>

<p>It is desired that this pause is temporary and will not last for an extended time.</p>

<p>Additional updates will be made available through this site and <a href="https://twitter.com/cely717">@cely717</a>.</p>
